The multiple choice final was a bit odd \u2013 I have never heard of theoretical arts subjects having final exams? Sometimes the reading load could be quite high. This course was the first time I had encountered a tangible level of cultural marxism at this university through an actual course \u2013 globalisation, globalism, erasure of historical identities, race, gender, etc. are all presented as unequivocally positive changes which media facilitates in the modern world in the readings and lectures. This one-sided view struck me as poor academic practice generally not characteristic of this university. Other than that the course was a let-down because it didn\u2019t examine the ways in which media can be used as brainwashing/propaganda which is what I had hoped to be learning about \u2013 it took the view that media is neutral and users define its meaning which I thought was quite an odd and abstract way to introduce media studies to first years. The assignments are the usual first year academic skills melded with course content sort of approach which was boring for a higher year person taking this as an elective. The instructions and feedback on these assignments was fairly poor. Overall I didn\u2019t enjoy this course as much as I had hoped to, but it wasn\u2019t too bad in the end.",

It may change again in the future but for 2017, you really had to know your referencing because there were a few written tasks including an annotated bibliography, essay and critical reflection. Look carefully at the course outline and pay attention to everything to prepare for the final multiple choice test. Good luck!",

Penny and Will do not know how to teach, they talk super academic in lectures and half the words that come out of their mouths i have never heard of. They also make questions super hard and everything hard in general. The weightings are also really bad - 50% for 1 assignment, 50% for 1 exam, so if you fuck up one your fucked.. Also with exam, you can't bring any material in so you are supposed to know all concepts well, plus examples to demonstrate, plus evidence from scholars quotes/ideas ect, and their fancy ass names to reference in the exam...

The subject areas are delivered with considered content for weekly readings and alongside a refreshingly high level of expectation for engagement through introspective writings or \"jottings\" to be done each week.

Labs are 3 hours long but if you finish early you can always do something else.\r\nThe course teaches you how to write scientific reports + look through journal articles and I think that's an important skill to have.

If you did biology in high school, some of the content will be pretty easy, just a bit more detailed. \r\nCourse manual is pretty good since it tells you everything that will happen in every lecture. \r\nIf you happen to be in one of the first lab sessions of the week, you're most likely to get the bad samples and reagents and have your lab practicals failing. Plan your lab work because demonstrators try to get you to choose which practicals you want to do first for good time management. If you happen to have Ted as your demonstrator.. good luck.

This is a good subject for business students who wants something different, or anyone else really who are passionate and interested in how to implement a change towards social change. We had four assignments - which involved a lot of writing (good idea to look at the course outline). It may vary, but my team was really nice and helpful and the lecturers was so lovely so i never felt stressed. I also believe that everyone's experience will differ depending on each's commitment and expectations towards the course. As a first year and being in my first semester, i struggled to keep up with all my courses. Thus i didn't exactly do all my lectures and readings in COMM1000, so i didn't get to experience it with my full potential. However looking back, it was a good subject that i did enjoy and i did quite well despite being in my first semester and lost. But that is only because i have a passion for social change. If you don't, i don't think you will enjoy it. There are definitely key learnings in this course that will definitely be fascinating for you if you do have a passion, in which you can take and implement further practically in real life! :D",

If It is your first time programming (just like I was), it is fast-paced, and you need to put a lot of effort to just keep up to date and absorb the material. Once it clicks with you, it is really rewarding and fun. The lecturers and tutors are truly incredible and you should definitely ask for help whenever you're stuck on something! There are also regular one-on-one help sessions that can be a lifesaver. There are 3 assignments and the final exam has hurdles on topic arrays and linked lists. \r\nTips to do well: Understand the lecture materials well (Go to tutors or help sessions if unsure), do all 1 and 2-star lab exercises and start assignments early! Never get 2+ weeks of content behind.",

However, the assessments tasks for this course were poorly designed and extremely vague in what was required to achieve a good mark, my tutor was even confused by the marking scheme that was given to us due to the lack of information. There were also only 2 assessments and no final exam, which meant that each assessment weighed heavily, making it difficult to achieve a distinction/high distinction. The only positive about the assessments was the flexibility in choosing a topic that you are personally interested in. Content varied, was either interesting or painfully boring. Don't make the same mistake that I did of scheduling your tutorial on the same day as the lecture as you will have to attend the 9am lecture in order to understand the tutorial. On the plus side, you can skip readings and taking notes as the assessments are almost solely based on your own research and there is no final exam.",

He is very knowledgable in both the academic and practical sense, however he constantly and consistently reads from his PowerPoint slides, word for word. These slides are very long and you will fight the urge to drift off. The course outline is 45 pages long and is VERY difficult to make sense of; often what Michael says contradicts the outline, and Michael doesn't seem to be able to clarify. \r\n\r\nHe marks the roll for each lecture. Tutorials are fantastic, with both tutors, Michael and Sam, as they create an ideal and safe environment which fosters active discussion about each week's topic. I learnt a lot in the tutorials and feel they are the best I've ever had. These classes are also very laid back and relaxed. The assessments are not difficult, although are quite lengthy and require you to reflect upon your own understanding and use your creativity.",

Cost estimation is so basic and is actually easier than the sorts of calculations done in 2nd year construction so I fail to see the point in including the same content again but at an easier level? Engineering economics is important to know about in general, but making us actually do financial calculations is somewhat irrelevant to real life where as engineers we would be interested in the results of such accounting calculations, not doing them ourselves. Finally inventory analysis seems odd and irrelevant. This course seems more suited to a degree in construction management, and while I guess the concepts are somewhat important in understanding real life engineering construction and management it\u2019s just a bit painful to go through as a course.

Get a good group to do the two-part fieldwork assignment with. You need to go map some rock geology which can be done in one day if you get there early and know what you are doing. On another day you need to do a self-guided walk looking at rock structures (fun) which will take at least 4 hours.

        "description": "Absolutely abysmal course with no organisation nor any actual care to provide quality teaching. Thought i was having a stroke trying to watch the prerecorded lectures where there are more errors than slides. Found recorded lectures from 2013 with unsurprisingly very similar slides but at least the lecturer was coherent. They put \"design\" in the course name because everything in the course is half-baked and your expected to make up for it. \r\n\r\nLectures were the hardest part to follow not because the content is hard which it isn't but i spent 75% of the time trying to figure out what the lecturer was supposed to say. Errors are often caught but for some reason the correction is edited out.\r\n\r\nFirst assignment was great, used the covered course content and the assignment mostly made sense. Takes heaps of time though. Ate up my whole flexweek.\r\n\r\nSecond assignment was easily one of the worst assignments i've seen. When a design brief requires more assumptions than the number of given requirements you should question if this is reasonable project to do let alone assign for students. They said you dont have to make all the assumptions but unless you want to graduate in the same decade yeah you do. The lecture also told us she made the assignments take heaps of time since most of us don't end up having time to attempt all the tutorial questions. Ye the math isn't mathing there. The content for the assignment was questionably covered. The logic simulation/programming we were required to use is covered in essentially only one lab in which the lab workbook seemed to assume some of this stuff would be covered in the lectures. Nothing about using several FSMs or multiple input FSMs in coding was covered at all.\r\n\r\nLabs were enjoyable and challenging and honestly the best part about the course. The lab demos carried all of us, answered every question we had and helped us deal with the temperamental coding program. Honestly felt like the labs helped me fully understand most of the course content.\r\n\r\nFinal was also terrible. They said do the past papers which seemed manageable and then they examined almost everything that wasn't in the past papers. Similar to the midterm, a lot of errors are in the worked solutions which doesn't give a lot of confidence to those currently sitting the course. Very poorly organised course. Couldnt even get an accurate assessment outline on moodle. Even in the final past papers i could see they try a new type of question, realise it doesnt make sense after the exam, fix a little bit and put in the next terms exam. So considering that most questions for my final seemed new, i don't feel confident at all. Im just disappointed that they using iterative deign on a damn uni course. This is supposed to be one of the top engineering unis in AUS? Definitely worth getting the textbook if you want to actually learn anything. There is quite a bit of content so read ahead and start your assignments early. For exams, they award of lot of marks just for working so attempt everything even if you don't know how to do it. Also, having a windows or linux pc will make assignments and labs go much smoother otherwise just use myaccess for the program. Be prepared for your wam to drop :(",

You could do the work at your own pace, as long as each module is completed within a week and it wasn't time-consuming at all; I was able to finish each week's worth of work within 2 days or so. The lecturer mostly just read through the slides so I ended up just downloading the slides and using them to answer the quiz questions instead of sitting through a 1hr+ lecture which saved me lots of time. There were only 2 essay-based assessments which involved your own research on a topic that interested you and 3 short compulsory tasks for certain topics (1 page max. of dot points mostly), no final exam. Content was kind of boring and didn't relate that much to assessment tasks so I mostly skimmed the slides to complete the weekly modules; however, I enjoyed researching and writing the assessment essays. Those who have studied legal studies in high school will find that some of the content overlaps which makes it easier to understand.

        "description": "I thought this subject would be interesting and chill but it was much harder than I imagined. The assessments were split into weekly online quizzes worth 20%, 2 written assignments (worth 20% and 40%) and a group presentation (worth 20%). Much of the content in the weekly quizzes were not covered in lectures and tutorials. Our written assignments were marked by Sophia Lin who was extremely harsh and quite unreasonable. These assignments required tremendous time and effort, only to receive lackluster marks from her who oftentimes did not provide proper reasons for deducing marks. The final written assignment (A4 Capstone Paper worth 40%) was vaguely explained. The group presentation was marked by our tutor Aidan who was more reasonable and lenient. If you are looking to boost your WAM/GPA I would advise staying away from this course as you will be spending hours upon hours grinding assignments and receive a final grade grade which is likely to be lower than for your core courses. I'd give this course 1 star but I'd like to leave an extra star to show my appreciation for Aidan and Rebecca who were great tutors. Rebecca (who we had for the first few weeks) was also a great lecturer but unfortunately Sophia really ruined my experience with this course.",

The lectures are no different to any other science lecture, which is a shame because the course is about physical activity and you would think that would be a good opportunity to do something interactive. I had a Sophia and Shaun as my lecturers. None of the online quizzes you do even correlate to what you have learnt in the lectures. But good thing there's Mr Google. For group presentation, make sure you get straight to the point to the topic. I provided the background information for my topic out of my group members and I lost heavy marks for that whereas everyone else discussed something that directly related to the topic so they weren't penalised, which I think is very stupid and unfair.",

The majority of criminal matters will never see a District or Supreme Court, and so the approach that UNSW has taken with this course with it's focus on lower courts is a great counterpoint to the traditional 'founding principles of criminal law' approach. I feel UNSW's criminal law education is actually the best in NSW, and I think this course, as long as you dig into it, is a major reason for that.",

        "description": "- i only began to enjoy the latter bit of the course when i was more engaged in it\r\n- had a strict and not very engaging tutor who marked slowly and didn't encourage enough CP. \r\n- online tutorials were dry and boring with just answering questions and got awkward at times when tutor didn't know his stuff\r\n- course should redesign tutorials esp online to be more interactive and activity based, rather than just a race to answer questions\r\n- more visuals in the ppt would have visualised the complicating steps when establishing certain parts of the concepts eg breach of duty, etc\r\n- less harsh with marking would help!!\r\n- interesting and important topics warmed up in laws1052 which was nice - cases all relevant and quite philosophical when you think about it\r\n- easy to follow course or moodle layout\r\n- overall tutor and staff were generally fair, altho could be more engaging\r\n- relevant assessments\r\n- writing notes or buying them is worth it. regret not putting in more effort right from the start but once i put my hand to the plough, jumped from a pass to a D in the final.\r\n- overall still a fun and really important/relevant course to law students",

Negligence is the most common tort however, so learning it as in depth as you do here likely has some utility.",

I liked the tutorials, my tutor was really nice & facilitated some good discussions. You get participation marks in the tutorials which are really easy to earn as long as you know the content (just keep talking & you\u2019ll surely get them, for the 2 marks I would just talk twice in each tutorial & I usually got full marks each time). The quizzes were hard just because the time limit was very restricting, my advice is to not dwell too long on any one question\u2014 choose your best guess & move on, you can come back to it later if you have time. I finished both quizzes & got good marks in both of them by doing this. The final 12 hour report was quite manageable but I felt that it was a bit subjective (\u201cwhat would you recommend\u201d for something was one of the questions if I recall correctly). You also have to do a group presentation which is a bit nerve wracking, but it\u2019s just for questions from the textbook. Overall I thought it was a good course, very easy to keep up with the material. However, the assessments could be modified. I loved my tutor but felt the main lecturer should\u2019ve been a bit more involved.",

Instead there was barely, if any useful feedback and I never had a clear idea of what it was that I needed to do in order to receive higher marks. I also felt that my class averages were a lot lower than that of those in other classes and my tutor never seemed to know what was going on.

These also prepare you for your assessments so don't skip them.\r\n- For the presentation (speech), try to make it interesting but from what I gather most marks go to the way you present more so than content, so complete it a couple days before and rehearse a lot.\r\n- Make sure your writing and english skills (grammar, punctuation etc) are up to par because a lot of marks get deducted for small errors.\r\n- I recommend reading a lot of examples of press release and character profiles from online sources etc to help you with your assignments.\r\n\r\nThe only downfall for this subject was that the marking for each assessment took WAY too long, and  I only ended up receiving constructive feedback for 1 assessment.",

        "description": "- very well structured and simple course with easy to follow moodle layout\r\n- easy but just heavy content. What you expect from a prelim-or entry lvl HR course, we look at health and safety regulations, remuneration, how to effectively organise human resource, etc\r\n- lecturer and tutor were really nice and awesome ppl as they were really punctual with presentation and handing back work\r\n- the course has only a handful of assessments so there is heavy weighting for each and therefore more pressure to do well at them. There should be less weighting/stress in future layout\r\n- few teamwork and team-based activities - good for if you wanna avoid the pull down of team mates.\r\n- we looked at article reviews ie age discrimination however tutorial materials seemed to be irrelevant to assignments at times. \r\n- CP not stressful due to nice tutor; but lecturer marks a bit harshly, given the poor cohort average. Nevertheless you get a bit of peer marking at the end which can potentially bring your grade up a bit. \r\n- finals seemed to be quite lecture-based, while textbook only served to enhance ur knowledge. Quite enjoyed the final; 2hrs seemed to be the perfect and fair challenging time\r\n- did average, wished i did better but given my effort it is what it is (76)",

Final exam fairly easy, only multiple choice questions. Some content interesting, such as social psychology but other aspects extremely dry. Don't bother with the textbook unless you're truly interested and plan on pursuing more PSYC classes - I didn't and saved $100+.

However learning paces are different for everyone and it may be easy for others. I would highly recommend looking at the course outline, before choosing this course to see if the topics being taught interest you. This is a first year psych course and a gen ed, however it won't be super easy to achieve the desire HD's and not a subject to just 'boost your wam'. You would really have to commit it, but overall it really is a valuable course and as long as you work hard you will do well. :)",

        "description": "Going in to the course, I was worried because of the negative reviews on here, however, I actually found this subject to be quite interesting and particularly enjoyed the case studies as they were applicable to the real world. I only attended 1 lecture and viewed the rest online, however, Siobhan is a great lecturer and you can tell that she is incredibly passionate about teaching policy. She's also extremely friendly and is enjoyable to listen to. I also didn't find it necessary to listen to every single lecture as there are only 2 essay-based assessments that focus on content covered in a particular week. I personally found the concepts to be relatively straightforward and easy to understand as it is mostly basic politics. Assessments were relatively easy to score good marks in, as long as you understood the concept and knew how to use case examples to back up your essay. I ended up with a HD without doing extensive study and because there is no final exam. Only downside to the course was the fieldwork component which I personally found to be kind of pointless, especially since it's not marked; however, it counts as 2 tutorials so you can miss out on a few tutes without any issues.",

Unfortunately yes, it is boring and tedious as previous comments have stated. However, everyone is different ofcourse and it is a good idea to look at the course outline to get a gist of it. Personally i found that it was reallyyy boring and HARD (especially for first years like me). However this course was mandatory for me, and if i had a choice i would not have chosen it, would not really recommend it unless you believe you will have a passion for it.",
